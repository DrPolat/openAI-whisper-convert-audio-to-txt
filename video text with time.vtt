00:00.000 --> 00:08.100
In this lecture we are gonna cover the pharmacology of immunosuppressants, so let's get right

00:08.100 --> 00:09.400
into it.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.000
The immune system is a complex network of cells and proteins that work together to defend

00:14.000 --> 00:18.720
the body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.840
Now the human immune system has two levels of immunity, innate and adaptive.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.500
The innate immunity is nonspecific and fast-acting, and serves as the primary line of protection

00:29.500 --> 00:31.980
against pathogen invasion.

00:31.980 --> 00:36.620
Numerous cells are involved in the innate immune response, including natural killer

00:36.620 --> 00:42.580
cells, mast cells and granulocytes, as well as the phagocytic cells such as macrophages,

00:42.580 --> 00:48.140
dendritic cells and monocytes, that utilize phagocytosis and are equipped with receptors

00:48.140 --> 00:53.760
which recognize a variety of microbial products known as antigens, resulting in activation

00:53.760 --> 00:59.000
of the slower-acting, but more specific, adaptive immune system.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.920
Now the adaptive immune system consists of highly specialized systemic cells and processes

01:03.920 --> 01:09.100
that are separated into two main components, the humoral and cellular.

01:09.100 --> 01:14.520
The humoral immunity is mediated by activated B cells that produce and secrete antibodies

01:14.520 --> 01:17.120
against a specific antigen.

01:17.120 --> 01:23.340
On the other hand, the cellular immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes, also called T cells.

01:23.340 --> 01:27.600
Now T cells circulate throughout the body until they recognize a specific antigen they

01:27.600 --> 01:33.380
are programmed for, on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells.

01:33.380 --> 01:40.020
The T cell receptor on both CD4-positive helper T cells and CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells

01:40.020 --> 01:45.820
binds to the antigen as it is held in a structure called the Major Histocompatibility Complex

01:45.820 --> 01:52.340
– MHC for short – in order to discriminate for and from self-antigens and initiate adaptive

01:52.340 --> 01:54.620
immune responses.

01:54.640 --> 02:00.560
This sets off a signaling cascade that allows T cells to replicate, differentiate, and secrete

02:00.560 --> 02:05.240
signaling proteins called cytokines, which in turn activate more cells of the immune

02:05.240 --> 02:07.080
system.

02:07.080 --> 02:12.640
Now depending on the type of T cell, either the core receptor CD8 or CD4 binds to the

02:12.640 --> 02:14.200
MHC molecule.

02:14.200 --> 02:19.280
The signal transduction is then carried through CD3 that is physically associated with a T

02:19.280 --> 02:20.800
cell receptor.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.060
However this initial signal is not sufficient for T cell activation, therefore a secondary

02:26.060 --> 02:28.300
signal is required.

02:28.300 --> 02:34.040
This secondary signal, also referred to as costimulation, occurs when CD28 receptor expressed

02:34.040 --> 02:41.100
on T cells binds CD80 and CD86 molecules that are expressed on antigen-presenting cells,

02:41.100 --> 02:45.900
thereby triggering a calcium-mediated signaling cascade.

02:45.900 --> 02:51.120
Basically a rise in intracellular calcium levels leads to a stepwise activation of the

02:51.120 --> 02:57.120
phosphatase calcine urine, an enzyme that dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated

02:57.120 --> 03:02.740
T cells – NFAT for short – which in turn allows it to translocate from the cytoplasm

03:02.740 --> 03:05.680
into the nucleus.

03:05.680 --> 03:11.080
Inside the nucleus, NFAT proteins bind DNA target sequences in cooperation with partnering

03:11.080 --> 03:16.980
transcription factors, leading to activation of genes encoding cytokines, one of which

03:16.980 --> 03:22.740
is a major growth factor called interleukin-2, IL-2 for short.

03:22.740 --> 03:28.900
Now generated interleukin-2 binds to the interleukin-2 receptors on the surface of T cells activating

03:28.900 --> 03:34.780
a signaling protein called a mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR for short, thereby allowing

03:34.780 --> 03:39.820
the cell to progress through the cell cycle, promoting cell proliferation of antigen-prime

03:39.840 --> 03:46.600
T cells, which subsequently produce more interleukin-2, as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines

03:46.600 --> 03:52.040
activating natural killer cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T cells.

03:52.040 --> 03:57.720
Alright, so the immune system is critical to survival in an environment full of pathogenic

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
microbes.

03:58.720 --> 04:04.760
However, this vital system is not always protective, as deregulation of immune responses can lead

04:04.760 --> 04:09.500
to chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmunity or cancer.

04:09.500 --> 04:14.620
Moreover, the immune system serves as a barrier for the transplantation of certain beneficial

04:14.620 --> 04:16.180
organs and tissues.

04:16.180 --> 04:21.820
Therefore, a continuous use of immunosuppressive drugs is the standard of care for managing

04:21.820 --> 04:25.380
autoimmunity and transplant rejection.

04:25.380 --> 04:29.380
Now immunosuppressive drug therapy usually consists of two or more agents with different

04:29.380 --> 04:34.240
mechanisms of action that disrupt various levels of T cell activation.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.220
So let's discuss these one by one, starting with calcine urine inhibitors.

04:39.220 --> 04:44.780
Drugs in this group work by binding to intracellular proteins called immunophilins.

04:44.780 --> 04:50.300
Immunophilins consist of two protein families, known as cyclophilins and FK-binding proteins,

04:50.300 --> 04:57.400
and are the major receptors for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus, respectively.

04:57.400 --> 05:02.420
These complexes then bind to and inhibit calcine urine, thereby preventing nuclear factor of

05:02.420 --> 05:07.680
activated T cells from moving to the nucleus, which ultimately impairs transcription of

05:07.680 --> 05:13.200
the genes encoding interleukin-2 that is necessary for activation of T cells.

05:13.200 --> 05:19.640
Alright, moving on to the next group of immunosuppressants, that is costimulation blockers.

05:19.640 --> 05:25.120
Drugs in this group include belatacept and abatacept, which work by selectively binding

05:25.120 --> 05:32.000
to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, thereby blocking interaction with CD28 on

05:32.000 --> 05:33.660
T cells.

05:33.660 --> 05:39.940
This in turn prevents complete T cell activation, reduces T cell proliferation and interleukin-2

05:39.940 --> 05:41.360
production.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.480
That being said, it's important to remember here that belatacept was designed to bind

05:45.480 --> 05:52.060
to CD80 and CD86 more strongly than abatacept and thus has been shown to be more effective

05:52.060 --> 05:56.340
in the immunosuppression necessary for transplant rejection.

05:56.340 --> 06:01.780
Now moving on to our third group of immunosuppressants, that is mTOR inhibitors.

06:01.780 --> 06:07.820
Drugs in this group include sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, and everolimus, which

06:07.820 --> 06:13.480
work by binding to the same intracellular FK-binding protein as tacrolimus, however

06:13.480 --> 06:19.400
instead of forming a complex with calcine urine, sirolimus and everolimus subsequently

06:19.400 --> 06:23.360
bind to mTOR, thereby inhibiting its activity.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.280
This ultimately leads to slowing or arrest of cell cycle progression, as well as inhibition

06:28.280 --> 06:32.260
of the cellular response to interleukin-2.

06:32.260 --> 06:37.180
Alright moving on to the next class of drugs that is immunosuppressive antimetabolites.

06:37.180 --> 06:42.960
The two most commonly used agents in this class are azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil,

06:42.960 --> 06:46.280
which have similar but unique mechanism of action.

06:46.280 --> 06:52.760
So the first one azathioprine is first activated to become 6 mercapto purine, 6MP for short,

06:52.760 --> 06:57.260
which is then further metabolized to form purine analogs that mimic the structure of

06:57.260 --> 06:59.720
a building block of DNA.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.680
These false purines in turn can disrupt the novel pathway of purine synthesis, as well

07:04.680 --> 07:10.600
as become incorporated into DNA and RNA, thus terminating their synthesis, ultimately inhibiting

07:10.600 --> 07:13.640
cellular proliferation.

07:13.640 --> 07:19.720
Now in contrast, the second agent, mycophenolate mofetil, works by inhibiting inosine monophosphate

07:19.720 --> 07:25.920
dehydrogenase, IMPDH for short, a key enzyme in purine synthesis, which is involved in

07:25.920 --> 07:28.820
the production of guanosine nucleotides.

07:28.820 --> 07:33.960
As a result, DNA synthesis, which requires guanosine triphosphate, does not occur and

07:33.960 --> 07:36.060
cell proliferation is inhibited.

07:36.060 --> 07:42.120
However, unlike azathioprine, mycophenolate is not incorporated into DNA and does not

07:42.120 --> 07:45.180
induce chromosome breaks.

07:45.180 --> 07:49.840
Now another class of drugs that is often used for immunosuppression in both transplantation

07:49.840 --> 07:53.920
and various autoimmune disorders is corticosteroids.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.620
Drugs that belong to this class include prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.

07:59.620 --> 08:05.180
So the effects of corticosteroids are diverse and are likely controlled by several mechanisms.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.620
One mechanism by which corticosteroids induce immunosuppression is through regulation of

08:09.620 --> 08:11.980
the T-cell responses.

08:11.980 --> 08:17.200
Acting directly on T-cells, corticosteroids mediate their effects by binding to the intracellular

08:17.200 --> 08:22.740
glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in translocation of the complex to the nucleus and subsequent

08:22.740 --> 08:28.580
inhibition of key transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappaB and activator

08:28.580 --> 08:35.860
protein 1, which ultimately alters gene transcription and represses pro-inflammatory genes.

08:35.860 --> 08:41.300
In addition to this, corticosteroids exert non-genomic actions by causing rapid dissociation

08:41.300 --> 08:47.660
of a T-cell receptor-associated protein complexes, resulting in impaired receptor signaling and

08:47.660 --> 08:49.460
T-cell activation.

08:49.460 --> 08:55.260
Finally, moving on to our last class of immunosuppressants, that is, antibodies.

08:55.260 --> 08:59.340
Now although many different antibody products exist, for the purpose of this lecture we

08:59.340 --> 09:03.260
are gonna focus here only on the two that are most commonly used to prevent transplant

09:03.260 --> 09:04.820
rejection.

09:04.820 --> 09:10.820
The first such product is anti-timocyte globulins, which consists of polyclonal antibodies that

09:10.820 --> 09:15.660
bind to a wide variety of proteins on the surface of T-cells, leading to cell death

09:15.660 --> 09:20.420
via complement-mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis.

09:20.420 --> 09:26.020
The second antibody product commonly used in transplant is basiliximab, which is a monoclonal

09:26.020 --> 09:32.160
antibody that binds to interleukin-2 receptor with similar affinity as interleukin-2, thereby

09:32.160 --> 09:37.660
effectively competing with interleukin-2 and subsequently inhibiting interleukin-2-driven

09:37.660 --> 09:40.780
T-cell proliferation.

09:40.780 --> 09:45.340
And with that I wanted to thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video, and as always

09:45.340 --> 09:46.300
stay tuned for more!

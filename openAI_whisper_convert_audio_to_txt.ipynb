            "[03:05.680 --> 03:11.080]  Inside the nucleus, NFAT proteins bind DNA target sequences in cooperation with partnering\n",

            "[03:52.040 --> 03:57.720]  Alright, so the immune system is critical to survival in an environment full of pathogenic\n",

            "[03:58.720 --> 04:04.760]  However, this vital system is not always protective, as deregulation of immune responses can lead\n",

            "[04:09.500 --> 04:14.620]  Moreover, the immune system serves as a barrier for the transplantation of certain beneficial\n",

            "[04:16.180 --> 04:21.820]  Therefore, a continuous use of immunosuppressive drugs is the standard of care for managing\n",

            "[04:25.380 --> 04:29.380]  Now immunosuppressive drug therapy usually consists of two or more agents with different\n",
            "[04:29.380 --> 04:34.240]  mechanisms of action that disrupt various levels of T cell activation.\n",
            "[04:34.240 --> 04:39.220]  So let's discuss these one by one, starting with calcine urine inhibitors.\n",
            "[04:39.220 --> 04:44.780]  Drugs in this group work by binding to intracellular proteins called immunophilins.\n",
            "[04:44.780 --> 04:50.300]  Immunophilins consist of two protein families, known as cyclophilins and FK-binding proteins,\n",
            "[04:50.300 --> 04:57.400]  and are the major receptors for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus, respectively.\n",
            "[04:57.400 --> 05:02.420]  These complexes then bind to and inhibit calcine urine, thereby preventing nuclear factor of\n",
            "[05:02.420 --> 05:07.680]  activated T cells from moving to the nucleus, which ultimately impairs transcription of\n",
            "[05:07.680 --> 05:13.200]  the genes encoding interleukin-2 that is necessary for activation of T cells.\n",
            "[05:13.200 --> 05:19.640]  Alright, moving on to the next group of immunosuppressants, that is costimulation blockers.\n",
            "[05:19.640 --> 05:25.120]  Drugs in this group include belatacept and abatacept, which work by selectively binding\n",
            "[05:25.120 --> 05:32.000]  to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, thereby blocking interaction with CD28 on\n",
            "[05:32.000 --> 05:33.660]  T cells.\n",
            "[05:33.660 --> 05:39.940]  This in turn prevents complete T cell activation, reduces T cell proliferation and interleukin-2\n",
            "[05:39.940 --> 05:41.360]  production.\n",
            "[05:41.360 --> 05:45.480]  That being said, it's important to remember here that belatacept was designed to bind\n",
            "[05:45.480 --> 05:52.060]  to CD80 and CD86 more strongly than abatacept and thus has been shown to be more effective\n",
            "[05:52.060 --> 05:56.340]  in the immunosuppression necessary for transplant rejection.\n",
            "[05:56.340 --> 06:01.780]  Now moving on to our third group of immunosuppressants, that is mTOR inhibitors.\n",
            "[06:01.780 --> 06:07.820]  Drugs in this group include sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, and everolimus, which\n",
            "[06:07.820 --> 06:13.480]  work by binding to the same intracellular FK-binding protein as tacrolimus, however\n",
            "[06:13.480 --> 06:19.400]  instead of forming a complex with calcine urine, sirolimus and everolimus subsequently\n",
            "[06:19.400 --> 06:23.360]  bind to mTOR, thereby inhibiting its activity.\n",
            "[06:23.360 --> 06:28.280]  This ultimately leads to slowing or arrest of cell cycle progression, as well as inhibition\n",
            "[06:28.280 --> 06:32.260]  of the cellular response to interleukin-2.\n",
            "[06:32.260 --> 06:37.180]  Alright moving on to the next class of drugs that is immunosuppressive antimetabolites.\n",
            "[06:37.180 --> 06:42.960]  The two most commonly used agents in this class are azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil,\n",
            "[06:42.960 --> 06:46.280]  which have similar but unique mechanism of action.\n",
            "[06:46.280 --> 06:52.760]  So the first one azathioprine is first activated to become 6 mercapto purine, 6MP for short,\n",
            "[06:52.760 --> 06:57.260]  which is then further metabolized to form purine analogs that mimic the structure of\n",
            "[06:57.260 --> 06:59.720]  a building block of DNA.\n",
            "[06:59.720 --> 07:04.680]  These false purines in turn can disrupt the novel pathway of purine synthesis, as well\n",
            "[07:04.680 --> 07:10.600]  as become incorporated into DNA and RNA, thus terminating their synthesis, ultimately inhibiting\n",
            "[07:10.600 --> 07:13.640]  cellular proliferation.\n",
            "[07:13.640 --> 07:19.720]  Now in contrast, the second agent, mycophenolate mofetil, works by inhibiting inosine monophosphate\n",
            "[07:19.720 --> 07:25.920]  dehydrogenase, IMPDH for short, a key enzyme in purine synthesis, which is involved in\n",
            "[07:25.920 --> 07:28.820]  the production of guanosine nucleotides.\n",
            "[07:28.820 --> 07:33.960]  As a result, DNA synthesis, which requires guanosine triphosphate, does not occur and\n",
            "[07:33.960 --> 07:36.060]  cell proliferation is inhibited.\n",
            "[07:36.060 --> 07:42.120]  However, unlike azathioprine, mycophenolate is not incorporated into DNA and does not\n",
            "[07:42.120 --> 07:45.180]  induce chromosome breaks.\n",
            "[07:45.180 --> 07:49.840]  Now another class of drugs that is often used for immunosuppression in both transplantation\n",
            "[07:49.840 --> 07:53.920]  and various autoimmune disorders is corticosteroids.\n",
            "[07:53.920 --> 07:59.620]  Drugs that belong to this class include prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.\n",
            "[07:59.620 --> 08:05.180]  So the effects of corticosteroids are diverse and are likely controlled by several mechanisms.\n",
            "[08:05.180 --> 08:09.620]  One mechanism by which corticosteroids induce immunosuppression is through regulation of\n",
            "[08:09.620 --> 08:11.980]  the T-cell responses.\n",
            "[08:11.980 --> 08:17.200]  Acting directly on T-cells, corticosteroids mediate their effects by binding to the intracellular\n",
            "[08:17.200 --> 08:22.740]  glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in translocation of the complex to the nucleus and subsequent\n",
            "[08:22.740 --> 08:28.580]  inhibition of key transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappaB and activator\n",
            "[08:28.580 --> 08:35.860]  protein 1, which ultimately alters gene transcription and represses pro-inflammatory genes.\n",
            "[08:35.860 --> 08:41.300]  In addition to this, corticosteroids exert non-genomic actions by causing rapid dissociation\n",
            "[08:41.300 --> 08:47.660]  of a T-cell receptor-associated protein complexes, resulting in impaired receptor signaling and\n",
            "[08:47.660 --> 08:49.460]  T-cell activation.\n",
            "[08:49.460 --> 08:55.260]  Finally, moving on to our last class of immunosuppressants, that is, antibodies.\n",
            "[08:55.260 --> 08:59.340]  Now although many different antibody products exist, for the purpose of this lecture we\n",
            "[08:59.340 --> 09:03.260]  are gonna focus here only on the two that are most commonly used to prevent transplant\n",
            "[09:03.260 --> 09:04.820]  rejection.\n",
            "[09:04.820 --> 09:10.820]  The first such product is anti-timocyte globulins, which consists of polyclonal antibodies that\n",
            "[09:10.820 --> 09:15.660]  bind to a wide variety of proteins on the surface of T-cells, leading to cell death\n",
            "[09:15.660 --> 09:20.420]  via complement-mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis.\n",
            "[09:20.420 --> 09:26.020]  The second antibody product commonly used in transplant is basiliximab, which is a monoclonal\n",
            "[09:26.020 --> 09:32.160]  antibody that binds to interleukin-2 receptor with similar affinity as interleukin-2, thereby\n",
            "[09:32.160 --> 09:37.660]  effectively competing with interleukin-2 and subsequently inhibiting interleukin-2-driven\n",

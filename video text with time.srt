1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
In this lecture we are gonna cover the pharmacology of immunosuppressants, so let's get right

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,400
into it.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,000
The immune system is a complex network of cells and proteins that work together to defend

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
the body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,840
Now the human immune system has two levels of immunity, innate and adaptive.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,500
The innate immunity is nonspecific and fast-acting, and serves as the primary line of protection

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,980
against pathogen invasion.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,620
Numerous cells are involved in the innate immune response, including natural killer

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,580
cells, mast cells and granulocytes, as well as the phagocytic cells such as macrophages,

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,140
dendritic cells and monocytes, that utilize phagocytosis and are equipped with receptors

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,760
which recognize a variety of microbial products known as antigens, resulting in activation

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,000
of the slower-acting, but more specific, adaptive immune system.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Now the adaptive immune system consists of highly specialized systemic cells and processes

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,100
that are separated into two main components, the humoral and cellular.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,520
The humoral immunity is mediated by activated B cells that produce and secrete antibodies

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,120
against a specific antigen.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,340
On the other hand, the cellular immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes, also called T cells.

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,600
Now T cells circulate throughout the body until they recognize a specific antigen they

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,380
are programmed for, on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,020
The T cell receptor on both CD4-positive helper T cells and CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells

21
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,820
binds to the antigen as it is held in a structure called the Major Histocompatibility Complex

22
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,340
– MHC for short – in order to discriminate for and from self-antigens and initiate adaptive

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,620
immune responses.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,560
This sets off a signaling cascade that allows T cells to replicate, differentiate, and secrete

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,240
signaling proteins called cytokines, which in turn activate more cells of the immune

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,080
system.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,640
Now depending on the type of T cell, either the core receptor CD8 or CD4 binds to the

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,200
MHC molecule.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,280
The signal transduction is then carried through CD3 that is physically associated with a T

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
cell receptor.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,060
However this initial signal is not sufficient for T cell activation, therefore a secondary

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,300
signal is required.

33
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,040
This secondary signal, also referred to as costimulation, occurs when CD28 receptor expressed

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,100
on T cells binds CD80 and CD86 molecules that are expressed on antigen-presenting cells,

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,900
thereby triggering a calcium-mediated signaling cascade.

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,120
Basically a rise in intracellular calcium levels leads to a stepwise activation of the

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,120
phosphatase calcine urine, an enzyme that dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,740
T cells – NFAT for short – which in turn allows it to translocate from the cytoplasm

39
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,680
into the nucleus.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,080
Inside the nucleus, NFAT proteins bind DNA target sequences in cooperation with partnering

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,980
transcription factors, leading to activation of genes encoding cytokines, one of which

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,740
is a major growth factor called interleukin-2, IL-2 for short.

43
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,900
Now generated interleukin-2 binds to the interleukin-2 receptors on the surface of T cells activating

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,780
a signaling protein called a mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR for short, thereby allowing

45
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,820
the cell to progress through the cell cycle, promoting cell proliferation of antigen-prime

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,600
T cells, which subsequently produce more interleukin-2, as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,040
activating natural killer cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T cells.

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,720
Alright, so the immune system is critical to survival in an environment full of pathogenic

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
microbes.

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,760
However, this vital system is not always protective, as deregulation of immune responses can lead

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,500
to chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmunity or cancer.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,620
Moreover, the immune system serves as a barrier for the transplantation of certain beneficial

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,180
organs and tissues.

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,820
Therefore, a continuous use of immunosuppressive drugs is the standard of care for managing

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,380
autoimmunity and transplant rejection.

56
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Now immunosuppressive drug therapy usually consists of two or more agents with different

57
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,240
mechanisms of action that disrupt various levels of T cell activation.

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,220
So let's discuss these one by one, starting with calcine urine inhibitors.

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,780
Drugs in this group work by binding to intracellular proteins called immunophilins.

60
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,300
Immunophilins consist of two protein families, known as cyclophilins and FK-binding proteins,

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,400
and are the major receptors for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus, respectively.

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,420
These complexes then bind to and inhibit calcine urine, thereby preventing nuclear factor of

63
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,680
activated T cells from moving to the nucleus, which ultimately impairs transcription of

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,200
the genes encoding interleukin-2 that is necessary for activation of T cells.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,640
Alright, moving on to the next group of immunosuppressants, that is costimulation blockers.

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,120
Drugs in this group include belatacept and abatacept, which work by selectively binding

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,000
to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, thereby blocking interaction with CD28 on

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,660
T cells.

69
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,940
This in turn prevents complete T cell activation, reduces T cell proliferation and interleukin-2

70
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,360
production.

71
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,480
That being said, it's important to remember here that belatacept was designed to bind

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,060
to CD80 and CD86 more strongly than abatacept and thus has been shown to be more effective

73
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,340
in the immunosuppression necessary for transplant rejection.

74
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,780
Now moving on to our third group of immunosuppressants, that is mTOR inhibitors.

75
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,820
Drugs in this group include sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, and everolimus, which

76
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,480
work by binding to the same intracellular FK-binding protein as tacrolimus, however

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,400
instead of forming a complex with calcine urine, sirolimus and everolimus subsequently

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,360
bind to mTOR, thereby inhibiting its activity.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,280
This ultimately leads to slowing or arrest of cell cycle progression, as well as inhibition

80
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,260
of the cellular response to interleukin-2.

81
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,180
Alright moving on to the next class of drugs that is immunosuppressive antimetabolites.

82
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,960
The two most commonly used agents in this class are azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil,

83
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,280
which have similar but unique mechanism of action.

84
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,760
So the first one azathioprine is first activated to become 6 mercapto purine, 6MP for short,

85
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,260
which is then further metabolized to form purine analogs that mimic the structure of

86
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,720
a building block of DNA.

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,680
These false purines in turn can disrupt the novel pathway of purine synthesis, as well

88
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,600
as become incorporated into DNA and RNA, thus terminating their synthesis, ultimately inhibiting

89
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,640
cellular proliferation.

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,720
Now in contrast, the second agent, mycophenolate mofetil, works by inhibiting inosine monophosphate

91
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,920
dehydrogenase, IMPDH for short, a key enzyme in purine synthesis, which is involved in

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,820
the production of guanosine nucleotides.

93
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,960
As a result, DNA synthesis, which requires guanosine triphosphate, does not occur and

94
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,060
cell proliferation is inhibited.

95
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,120
However, unlike azathioprine, mycophenolate is not incorporated into DNA and does not

96
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,180
induce chromosome breaks.

97
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,840
Now another class of drugs that is often used for immunosuppression in both transplantation

98
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,920
and various autoimmune disorders is corticosteroids.

99
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,620
Drugs that belong to this class include prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.

100
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,180
So the effects of corticosteroids are diverse and are likely controlled by several mechanisms.

101
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,620
One mechanism by which corticosteroids induce immunosuppression is through regulation of

102
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,980
the T-cell responses.

103
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,200
Acting directly on T-cells, corticosteroids mediate their effects by binding to the intracellular

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,740
glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in translocation of the complex to the nucleus and subsequent

105
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,580
inhibition of key transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappaB and activator

106
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,860
protein 1, which ultimately alters gene transcription and represses pro-inflammatory genes.

107
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,300
In addition to this, corticosteroids exert non-genomic actions by causing rapid dissociation

108
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,660
of a T-cell receptor-associated protein complexes, resulting in impaired receptor signaling and

109
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,460
T-cell activation.

110
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,260
Finally, moving on to our last class of immunosuppressants, that is, antibodies.

111
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,340
Now although many different antibody products exist, for the purpose of this lecture we

112
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,260
are gonna focus here only on the two that are most commonly used to prevent transplant

113
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,820
rejection.

114
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,820
The first such product is anti-timocyte globulins, which consists of polyclonal antibodies that

115
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,660
bind to a wide variety of proteins on the surface of T-cells, leading to cell death

116
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,420
via complement-mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis.

117
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,020
The second antibody product commonly used in transplant is basiliximab, which is a monoclonal

118
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,160
antibody that binds to interleukin-2 receptor with similar affinity as interleukin-2, thereby

119
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,660
effectively competing with interleukin-2 and subsequently inhibiting interleukin-2-driven

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,780
T-cell proliferation.

121
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,340
And with that I wanted to thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video, and as always

122
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,300
stay tuned for more!
